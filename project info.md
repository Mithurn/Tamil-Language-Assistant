Project Context: Tamil Language Assistant Chrome Extension
Overview

This project is a hackathon entry focused on building a comprehensive Tamil language assistant as a Chrome extension. Inspired by the Gemini Chrome extension, it aims to provide seamless language support across all Chrome browsing experiences. The core features include real-time spell checking and grammar checking for Tamil text, with additional tools for text enhancement and processing. All functionalities leverage the Gemini API for AI-powered processing. The goal is to create the best Tamil language assistant, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and integration without disruptive popups.
The extension operates universally in Chrome when enabled, with outputs primarily displayed in a right-side chat panel similar to the Gemini extension. Inline features like spell check and sentence correction work directly within text fields across websites (e.g., email compose boxes, forms, etc.), while other features appear in the chat panel.

Core Features:

1. Spell Check

Integration and UI: Simple toolbox integration with a clean, intuitive tooltip UI that aligns aesthetically with the right-side chat panel.
Behavior:

Activates as the user types in any Chrome text field.
Triggers only after a full word is typed (e.g., upon space or punctuation) to minimize API calls and avoid constant interruptions.
Displays a tooltip below the misspelled word, suggesting the correct spelling (fetched via Gemini API).
Tooltip appears once per error and does not reappear unnecessarily.
User can click the suggested word to auto-replace the incorrect one.
-let users hover on the text they typed to see the correct word and let them click on the tooltip itself to correc the wrong word that was typed in the text field


Scope: Works globally in Chrome when the extension is active. Optionally, provide a toggle to enable/disable spell check; if not feasible, keep it always on.

2. Grammar Check

Checks grammar for entire sentences or paragraphs.
Inline correction for whole sentences where applicable (e.g., suggesting fixes directly in text fields).
Detailed outputs and suggestions appear in the right-side chat panel.

3. Additional Features (Time-Permitting)

Summarize: Condense selected text or paragraphs.
Translate: Translate Tamil text to/from other languages.
Voice Bot: Voice-activated assistance for dictation or queries.
Text Enhancement Tools (planned for later iterations):

Rewrite in formal tone.
Rewrite to be persuasive.
Rewrite in friendly tone.
Improve readability.
Rephrase.
Clarify and explain.
all of these additional features output should appear in the right-side chat panel.



Technical Details

API Usage: All AI-driven features (spell check, grammar check, summarization, etc.) are powered by the Gemini API to ensure accurate Tamil language handling.
UI/UX Principles:

No unnecessary popups; all non-inline outputs routed to the right-side chat panel for a non-intrusive experience.
Inline features (spell check, sentence correction) integrate directly into Chrome's text inputs for real-time assistance.


Extension Scope: Designed to function everywhere in Chrome, providing ubiquitous Tamil language support.

Goals and Vision
The project aspires to be the premier Tamil language assistant, empowering users with efficient, AI-enhanced tools for writing, editing, and communicating in Tamil. It prioritizes performance (e.g., optimized API calls), user-friendly design, and expandability for future features. This context can be used as a reference for development, documentation, or integration with other AI systems to maintain consistency.
