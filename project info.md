Project Name: Your Tamil AI Writing Partner

The Problem statement🎯
To make a Tamil language assistant tool for spell check and grammar

but that is too basic so we will be adfding new features for sure 

Our Solution ✨
it is an intelligent, all-in-one AI assistant that makes writing in Tamil seamless and professional. It’s not just a checker; it’s a writing partner that understands context. It provides the confidence to write anything from a quick message to a formal document flawlessly.

Key Features
Advanced Spell & Grammar Correction: Catches complex errors that other tools miss. we can use api to make it easy or any other better ways

Contextual Formality Shifter: The "killer feature." Instantly converts text between casual, spoken Tamil (பேச்சுத்தமிழ்) and professional, written Tamil (செந்தமிழ்).

"Tanglish" to Tamil Conversion: Automatically transliterates Tamil typed with English letters into the correct Tamil script.

Our Hackathon Plan (The Next 24 Hours)
Our goal is a polished, working demo.

Build the AI Engine: We will create a powerful backend API using Python. This engine will connect to a Large Language Model (like Gemini) to perform all the complex language tasks.

Create the Web App: We will develop a clean and simple web interface (using HTML, CSS, JS) where users can input text and see the AI work its magic in real time ( just till we get the backend working)

Integrate & Perfect: We'll connect the frontend and backend, test thoroughly, and ensure our demo is fast, impressive, and bug-free.

FUTURE PLANS:
The web app is just the beginning.
once the backend is done 

we should Integrate this directly into Chrome and other browsers as an extension, providing a side-panel assistant that works on Gmail, Facebook, and more. like in the google gemini chrome extension


Expand Features: Add a style guide, a plagiarism checker, and document analysis tools to become the go-to professional writing tool for Tamil.
